# Healthcare Use Case Demos

This folder includes the following Machine Learning applications for healthcare:

- A model to predict health of fetuses based on cardiotocogram signals.
- A model to predict Parkinson disease from variations in speech characteristics.
- A model to predict breast cancer from biospy cell image characteristics.

These examples showcase the use of Oracle Accelerated Data Science packages (ADS) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including feature selection, autoML for model selection and hyper-parameters tuning, evaluators to compare model performance, and the explainer framework to explain the model's behavior and feature importance.

# TensorBoard

TensorBoard helps visualizing your experiments. You bring up a ``TensorBoard`` session on your workstation and point to
the directory that contains the TensorBoard logs.

**Prerequisite**

1. Object storage bucket
2. Access to Object Storage bucket from your workstation
3. ``ocifs`` version 1.1.0 and above

Setting up local environment
----------------------------

It is required that ``tensorboard`` is installed in a dedicated conda environment or virtual environment. Prepare an
environment yaml file for creating conda environment with following command -

```
cat <<EOF > tensorboard-dep.yaml
dependencies:
- python=3.8
- pip
- pip:
    - ocifs
    - tensorboard
name: tensorboard
EOF
```

Create the conda environment from the yaml file generated in the preceeding step

    conda env create -f tensorboard-dep.yaml

This will create a conda environment called tensorboard. Activate the conda environment by running -

    conda activate tensorboard

**Using TensorBoard Logs:**

To launch a TensorBoard session on your local workstation, run - 

    export OCIFS_IAM_KEY=api_key # If you are using resource principal, set resource_principal
    tensorboard --logdir oci://my-bucket@my-namespace/path/to/logs

This will bring up TensorBoard app on your workstation. Access TensorBoard at ``http://localhost:6006/``

**Note**: The logs take some initial time (few minutes) to reflect on the tensorboard dashboard.

#### Writing TensorBoard logs to Object Storage

Your training script can write tensorboard logs to the directory reference by ``OCI__SYNC_DIR`` env variable.
With ``SYNC_ARTIFACTS=1`` in train.yaml, these TensorBoard logs will be periodically synchronized with the configured object storage
bucket.
